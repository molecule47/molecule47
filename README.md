I'm a tech enthusiast and a programmer, pursuing theorectical sciences as my future field of study. I have been around computers all my life, I love to solve technical problems and create software that is relevant and has real-world implications. Furthermore, I've always been improving to reach the path to achieve brilliance. 

I specialize in the following skills:  
â†’ Python  
â†’ HTML, CSS  
â†’ MySQL  
â†’ Ethical Hacking (Penetration Testing, etc.)  

I have 2 years of experience with Linux and I have successfully created Discord bots with exceptional features. Learning new things and using code to solve problems has always been common in my life.
